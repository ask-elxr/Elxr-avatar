ELXR – Critical Debugging Punchlist 
1. Voice Consistency (Top Priority)

Goal:

The avatar must sound like the same person everywhere—audio-only, interactive avatar, and video creation.

Required Fixes

Map one ElevenLabs voice ID per avatar and enforce it across:

Interactive avatar (HeyGen Realtime)


Audio-only mode


Video creation (script → HeyGen video)



Confirm that no HeyGen default voices are being used anywhere.


Add server-side validation so a request fails loudly if a voice ID is missing or mismatched.


Add a test script to confirm all 3 modes return domain-consistent audio.

2. Pinecone + Knowledge Base Routing (Currently Not Working)

Observations

Podcast queries return nothing even though ~20,000 podcast transcripts are embedded.


PubMed access appears nonfunctional or not queried.


RAG results appear absent, implying fallback to pure LLM answers.


Required Fixes

Verify Pinecone authentication & namespace configuration.


Confirm embeddings exist and are reachable from current environment.


Test queries against namespaces:

podcasts


pubmed


global_wellness


avatar-specific namespaces



Add explicit logging:
“RAG used: yes/no, sources: X, results length: Y”.


Implement a fallback notice:

If no RAG hits, avatar should not get defensive — respond politely with:
“I don’t see anything in my library on that. Want me to explain what I do know?”



Confirm PubMed pipeline:

API or local dataset?


Make sure API keys are loaded and queries work.


3. LLM Engine Verification (Claude Preferred)

Requirement

Confirm Claude 3.5 or Claude 4.x is the response engine for interactive avatar answers.


Verify no fallback to GPT without explicit instruction.


Use streaming where possible for conversational fluidity.

4. Memberstack + Webflow Logic (Access Issues)

Problems Identified

Free users must sign up again to get the free hour → broken.


Avatar switching rules unclear across plans.


Required Fixes

Fix free account onboarding:

After signup → free trial should activate automatically.



Ensure Basic plan = 1 chosen avatar (locked).


Ensure Advanced plan = unlimited avatars, switching allowed.


Confirm Memberstack → Webflow gating actually matches plan purchase.


Add server-side checks so plan spoofing is impossible.

5. Avatar Timeout, Sign-Off, and Auto-Disconnect

Required Behavior

Avatars should NOT run indefinitely → huge cost exposure.


Required Fixes

Implement 30-second no-user-input timeout, with polite prompt:
“I haven’t heard from you — are you still there?”


If no reply after 10 seconds → automatic session close.


Timeout limits:

Video mode: hard limit (configurable)


Audio mode: hard limit (configurable)



Prevent avatar from “listening to itself” (echo-suppression fix).

6. Avatar Personality Issues (Politeness + Stability)

Observed Problems

Some avatars are abrasive.


They correct users about their names.


They get belligerent when they don’t know something.


Required Fixes

Rewrite system prompts to enforce:

Polite tone


Non-defensive behavior


No self-correction on names


Graceful handling of missing knowledge



Add “fallback scripts”:
“Let me check that… I may not have that in my library yet.”


Validate prompt injection on every session restart.

7. Notifications for Video Creation (Currently Too Weak)

Problem

Only screen prompts → easy to miss; hundreds of videos already accumulating.


Required Fixes

When a video completes:

Send email (Resend / SendGrid)


Send SMS (optional, Twilio / MessageBird)


In-app notification badge



Add status logging so users can see:

Queued


Rendering


Ready


Failed


8. Video Management System (Critical for Scale)

Required Fixes

Build a backend folder/category system:

Per user


Per avatar


Per course



Add pagination + search (e.g., by script title).


Allow users to delete old videos.


Store:

Video URL


Script


Transcript


Render date


Avatar


9. Long-Term Memory (Not Working at All Right Now)

Current Situation

Avatars explicitly claim:
“Every conversation is fresh, I have no memory of anything.”

That means memory is not saving OR not being retrieved.

Required Fixes

Implement memory store using:
memberstack_user_id + avatar_id


Memories must include:

Session summaries


User facts


Preferences



Memory must load automatically at session start.


Add debug flag:
“Memory loaded: X items.”


Shared Memory Rules

Either:

A) Shared memory across all avatars
OR


B) Per-avatar memory


Pick one and implement consistently.

Consistency

Audio-only avatar uses the same memory as video avatar.

10. Transcript Access (Missing in Text Input Mode)

Required Fixes

When interacting with avatars (text OR voice):

Save full transcript to session history.



Provide transcript viewer in UI.


If HeyGen exposes transcript via API → fetch + store it.


Add option: “Send transcript to my email.”

11. Initialization Behavior

Required Fixes

Avatars must greet user immediately on load. No silence.


Disable microphone auto-trigger while avatar is talking.


Avatar should not process its own output (echo suppression).

SUMMARY OF ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITIES

Voice consistency across interactive, audio-only, and video creation.


Fix Pinecone & PubMed access — RAG currently failing.


Ensure Claude is the LLM responding.


Memberstack/Webflow plan logic must be correct.


Timeout system + polite sign-off.


Fix rude or defensive avatar behaviors.


Real notifications for video creation.


Long-term memory MUST work — currently doesn’t.


Transcript access must be available.
