injected.js:37 Claude response received: Hey - I'm Mark Kohl.

The knowledge base I have loaded right now focuses on telomeres and DNA replication at the cellular level, plus some municipal infrastructure discussion - nothing about the higher self in kundalini practice. What I can access from web search shows there are manuals on kundalini and chakras available, including Itzhak Bentov's "Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness," but I don't have the actual content from those sources loaded.

The higher self in kundalini tradition typically refers to your expanded consciousness beyond ego identification - the awakened state you access when kundalini energy rises through the chakras from the base of the spine to the crown. But I don't have detailed verified knowledge on this topic in my current resources to give you the depth you're asking for.

Would you like me to go deeper on any part of that?

I don't have information about 4D, 5D, or 6D dimensions in my current knowledge base. What's loaded right now is content about telomeres and cellular aging, plus some municipal infrastructure discussion - nothing related to dimensional theory or consciousness states.
