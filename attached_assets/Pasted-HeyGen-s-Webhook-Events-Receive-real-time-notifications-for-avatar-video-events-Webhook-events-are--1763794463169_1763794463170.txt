HeyGen's Webhook Events
Receive real-time notifications for avatar video events

Webhook events are how HeyGen notifies your endpoints when a variety of interactions or events happen, including when avatar video processing succeeds or fails. Webhook events are sent by HeyGen as POST requests to your webhook endpoint.

Getting Started

avatar_video_gif.successand.fail- similar to avatar_video events, but for GIF output
video_translate.success - triggered when a translated video is ready
video_translate.fail - triggered when video translation fails
personalized_video- triggered when a personalized video is generated

HeyGen sends these webhook events to your configured endpoint based on your subscriptions. You will only receive events that you have subscribed to.

Your endpoint will receive payloads in the following formats when subscribed webhook events are triggered.

The examples above show the most common webhook payloads. Additional events follow a similar structure. You can view sample payloads for each event directly in your webhook logs or via test callbacks.
Register a Webhook Endpoint
Use Add a Webhook Endpoint API to register your endpoint which is used to process HeyGen events. Specify the list of events you want to subscribe to. When registering, you also need to specify url.

📘
Our webhook validation performs an OPTIONS request to your endpoint with a 1-second timeout, so ensure your server responds quickly and accepts OPTIONS requests, even if your main functionality uses different HTTP methods.

List Registered Webhook Endpoints
You can use the List Webhook Endpoints endpoint to list your registered endpoints. The response includes details of each registered webhook endpoint such as its url, events, and endpoint_id.

Update a Registered Webhook Endpoint
Use Update a Webhook Endpoint to update the information of a registered endpoint. Ensure you include both endpoint_id and urlin the request body when updating a webhook endpoint.

📘
If the url is omitted, the API currently returns the existing resource unchanged instead of generating an error.
