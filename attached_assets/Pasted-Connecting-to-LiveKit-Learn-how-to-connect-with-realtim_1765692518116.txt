Overview
Your application will connect to LiveKit using the Room object, which is the base construct in LiveKit. Think of it like a conference call — multiple participants can join a room and share realtime audio, video, and data with each other.

Depending on your application, each participant might represent a user, an AI agent, a connected device, or some other program you've created. There is no limit on the number of participants in a room and each participant can publish audio, video, and data to the room.

Installing the LiveKit SDK
LiveKit includes open-source SDKs for every major platform including JavaScript, Swift, Android, React Native, Flutter, and Unity.

LiveKit also has SDKs for realtime backend apps in Python, Node.js, Go, and Rust. These are designed to be used with the Agents framework for realtime AI applications.

Install the LiveKit SDK and optional React Components library:

npm install livekit-client @livekit/components-react @livekit/components-styles --save

The SDK is also available using yarn or pnpm.

Also check out the dedicated quickstart for React.

Add the Swift SDK and the optional Swift Components library to your project using Swift Package Manager. The package URLs are:

https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-swift
https://github.com/livekit/components-swift
See Adding package dependencies to your app for more details.

You must also declare camera and microphone permissions, if needed in your Info.plist file:


For more details, see the Swift quickstart.

The LiveKit SDK and components library are available as Maven packages.


See the releases page for information on the latest version of the SDK.

You'll also need JitPack as one of your repositories. In your settings.gradle file:


Install the React Native SDK with NPM:


Check out the dedicated quickstart for Expo or React Native for more details.

Install the latest version of the Flutter SDK and components library.


You'll also need to declare camera and microphone permissions. See the Flutter quickstart for more details.

If your SDK is not listed above, check out the full list of platform-specific quickstarts and SDK reference docs for more details.

Connecting to a room
Rooms are identified by their name, which can be any unique string. The room itself is created automatically when the first participant joins, and is closed when the last participant leaves.

You must use a participant identity when you connect to a room. This identity can be any string, but must be unique to each participant.

Connecting to a room always requires two parameters:

wsUrl: The WebSocket URL of your LiveKit server.
LiveKit Cloud users can find theirs on the Project Settings page.
Self-hosted users who followed this guide can use ws://localhost:7880 while developing.
token: A unique access token which each participant must use to connect.
The token encodes the room name, the participant's identity, and their permissions.
For help generating tokens, see this guide.
JavaScriptReactSwiftAndroidReact NativeFlutter
const room = new Room();
await room.connect(wsUrl, token);

<LiveKitRoom audio={true} video={true} token={token} serverUrl={wsUrl}>
  <!-- your components here -->
</LiveKitRoom>

RoomScope(url: wsURL, token: token, connect: true, enableCamera: true) {
  // your components here
}

RoomScope(
  url = wsURL,
  token = token,
  audio = true,
  video = true,
  connect = true,
) {
  // your components here
}

<LiveKitRoom audio={true} video={true} token={token} serverUrl={wsUrl}>
  <!-- your components here -->
</LiveKitRoom>

final room = Room();
await room.connect(wsUrl, token);

Upon successful connection, the Room object will contain two key attributes: a localParticipant object, representing the current user, and remoteParticipants, an array of other participants in the room.

Once connected, you can publish and subscribe to realtime media tracks or exchange data with other participants.

LiveKit also emits a number of events on the Room object, such as when new participants join or tracks are published. For details, see Handling Events.

Disconnection
Call Room.disconnect() to leave the room. If you terminate the application without calling disconnect(), your participant disappears after 15 seconds.
