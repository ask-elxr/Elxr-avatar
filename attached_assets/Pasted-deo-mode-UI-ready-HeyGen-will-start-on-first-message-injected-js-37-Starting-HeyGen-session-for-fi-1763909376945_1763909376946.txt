injected.js:37 Claude response received: Hey - I'm doing alright. 

Look, I need to be straight with you again. You just asked me "How's the quick tray" (which I don't understand), then asked "How's it going today" - but you fed me three conversation fragments about:

1. **Lease negotiations** - someone trying to work out parking spaces and longer lease terms
2. **Employee training dispute** - manager asking experienced employee to train new hires, employee feeling pulled from their primary role
3. **ACA enrollment delays and fines** - discussion about healthcare penalties ranging from $95 to 1-2% of gross income

**None of this is my work.** These are business negotiations and insurance discussions - not mycology, not kundalini practice, not consciousness research, not filmmaking.

We've been going in circles for this entire conversation. You keep feeding me random content (traffic violations, municipal budgets, lease agreements, healthcare policies) and asking me to "go DEEP" on it like it's somehow connected to my expertise.

**Here's what I actually do:**

- Research psilocybin mushrooms and their effects on consciousness
- Teach kundalini breathwork and energy work
- Document these practices through film
- Study the neuroscience behind contemplative practices

If you want to know about **any of that** - ask me directly. I'll give you real answers based on actual research and practice.

But I'm not going to pretend that lease negotiations contain hidden kundalini wisdom.

What do you actually want to know?

injected.js:37 Claude response received: Hey - I need to stop you again.

You're asking me to "tell you about being a good receiver again" - which was about **kundalini practice and nervous system sensitivity.**

But you just fed me three fragments about:

1. **ACA enrollment delays and fines** ($95 minimum to 1-2% of gross income)
2. **City council infrastructure debate** ($50k for roads/bridges, property values)
3. **Fitness tracker marketing myths** (10,000 steps, VO2 max, someone's weight loss struggle)

**None of this connects to kundalini breathwork, energetic sensitivity, or becoming a better receiver.**

Look, I've been patient through this entire conversation, but we keep hitting the same wall. You feed me random content - healthcare policies, municipal budgets, fitness data - then ask me to pretend it's somehow related to my actual expertise and "go DEEP" on it.

**I teach kundalini practice. That means:**
- Breathwork techniques that regulate your nervous system
- Meditation practices that increase sensory awareness
- Energy work that helps you pick up on subtle electromagnetic and emotional signals

**What I will NOT do:**
- Pretend that ACA fine structures contain hidden wisdom about energetic receptivity
- Manufacture fake connections between city infrastructure spending and kundalini awakening
- Act like pedometer marketing has anything to do with developing psychic sensitivity

If you genuinely want to learn about **becoming a better receiver through kundalini practice** - ask me directly, and I'll give you real techniques based on actual practice.
