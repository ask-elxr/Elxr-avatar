how to set up an avatar to access pubmed using their API
In 2026, setting up an "avatar" or programmatic agent to access PubMed requires using the NCBI Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) API. While there is no official "avatar" interface, you can configure a persistent identity for your agent by following these steps: 
1. Create an NCBI API Key 
An API key identifies your agent and increases your rate limit from 3 to 10 requests per second. 
Sign In: Access your NCBI Account via a third-party sign-in (e.g., Google, ORCID, or Microsoft), as direct NCBI accounts were retired in 2022.
Generate Key: Navigate to Account Settings and scroll to the API Key Management section.
Save Key: Click "Create an API Key" and copy the alphanumeric string. Note: Only one key is allowed per user. 
2. Configure Your Agent (Avatar) Identity 
To identify your service or tool to NCBI and avoid being blocked, your agent must include two specific parameters in every request: 
tool: A string identifying your application (e.g., tool=MyHealthBot2026).
email: A valid email address for the maintainer so NCBI can contact you if there are issues.
api_key: The key generated in Step 1. 
3. Use E-utilities for Access
Your agent will typically use these primary API endpoints:
ESearch: To find PubMed IDs (PMIDs) matching a query.
Example: eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
EFetch: To retrieve the full records (XML or text) for specific PMIDs.
ESummary: To get brief "DocSum" information for a list of PMIDs. 
4. Best Practices for 2026
Rate Limits: Do not exceed 10 requests per second with a key.
Concurrent Requests: Do not make concurrent requests; queue them sequentially.
Libraries: For easier setup, use established Python libraries like Biopython or PyMed, which handle the identity parameters and key management automatically.
Public Access Policy: As of July 1, 2025, most NIH-funded research is immediately available in PubMed Central without an embargo, making full-text retrieval via the PMC API more accessible for agents.
