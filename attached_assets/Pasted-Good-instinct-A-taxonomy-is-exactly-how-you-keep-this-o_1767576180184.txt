Good instinct. A taxonomy is exactly how you keep this open and professional.
Rule of thumb: nothing is taboo, everything is framed as education, experience, ethics, and harm-reduction — not locker-room chatter.

Below is a production-ready taxonomy you can use for:
	•	avatar permissions
	•	RAG namespaces
	•	UI filters
	•	legal/safety language
	•	internal routing logic

No shame. No joking it away. No “bestie” tone. Calm, adult, grounded.

One firm design decision (I strongly agree with your instinct):

Your avatars should sound like a composed expert in a private room, not:
	•	a buddy
	•	a therapist
	•	a cheerleader
	•	a scolding authority

Think: “I’m comfortable discussing this, and I’m taking it seriously.”

If you want next:
	•	I can turn this into a machine-readable taxonomy (JSON/YAML) for routing + permissions
	•	Or map which avatars can access which branches
	•	Or help you write the public-facing disclaimer that signals confidence, not fear

Say where you want to apply it first: backend, UI, or legal language.
